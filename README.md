# Online Job Marketplaces Scraper
This repository contains scripts that were used to crawl and scrape online job marketplaces such as TaskRabbit and Fiverr 
for research purposes. The way scraping is conducted is similar across all platforms that we scraped; we define a set queries where a query is a combination of parameters that yield a ranked 
list of users. For example, in TaskRabbit's case that would be a combination of a location and service
type, i.e. _Home Cleaners in New York_.

## Requirements
